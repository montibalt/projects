          <h2>What is Gross Domestic Product</h2>
        </header>
        <p>Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is the monetary value, in local currency, of all final economic goods and services produced in a country during a specific period of time.</p>
        <p>GDP is a measure of (national income = national output = national expenditure) produced in a particular country.</p>
        <p><b>What is the GDP formula?</b></p>
        <p>3 methods to calculate GDP:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Income:</li>
          <code> Wages + Rent + Interest + Profit</code>
          <li>Output:</li>
          <code>sum of 1st, 2nd, 3rd sectors’ outputs</code>
          <li>Expenditure:</li>
          <p>The components of GDP are:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Personal consumption (C)</li>
            <li>Business investment (I)</li>
            <li>Government spending (G)</li>
            <li>Exports - imports (X)</li>
          </ul>
        </ol>
        <p>GDP is calculated as:</p>
        <code>GDP = C + I + G + X</code>

          <h2>What is Gross National Product</h2>
        </header>
        <p>Gross National Product (GNP) can be defined as an economic statistic which includes Gross Domestic Product, plus any income earned by the residents from investments made overseas.</p>
        <code>GNP (Gross National Product) = GDP + net property income from abroad*</code>
        <p>*This net income from abroad includes dividends, interest and profit.</p>
      </section>

          <h2>What is Gross National Income</h2>
        </header>
        <p>GNI (Gross National Income) is based on a similar principle to GNP. The World Bank defines GNI as</p>
        <blockquote>
          <q>GNI is the sum of value added by all resident producers plus any product taxes (minus subsidies) not included in the valuation of output plus net receipts of primary income (compensation of employees and property income) from abroad.</q> (<i>World Bank</i>)
        </blockquote>
        <p class="green"><em>The World Bank now use GNI rather than GNP.</em></p>
        <p>GNI uses GDP and two different types of income circumstances:
          <ul>
            <li>Income from citizens and businesses earned abroad (A)</li>
            <li>Income remitted by foreigners living in the country back to their home countries (B)</li>
          </ul>
          This gives the formula:
        </p>
        <code>GNI = GDP + [ ( A ) – ( B ) ]</code>

          <h2>Difference between GNP GDP and GNI</h2>
        </header>
        <p>GNP and GDP both reflect the national output and income of an economy. The main difference is that GNP (Gross National Product) takes into account net income receipts from abroad.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>GDP (Gross Domestic Product) is a measure of (national income = national output = national expenditure) produced in a particular country.</li>
          <li>GNP (Gross National Product) = GDP + net property income from abroad. This net income from abroad includes dividends, interest and profit.</li>
          <li>GNI (Gross National Income) = (similar to GNP) includes the value of all goods and services produced by nationals – whether in the country or not.</li>
        </ul>

          <h2>Why is GDP Important to Economists and Investors</h2>
        </header>
        <p>It represents the value of all goods and services produced over a specific time period within a country's borders.</p>
        <p>Economists can use GDP to determine whether an economy is growing or experiencing a recession.</p>
        <p>Investors can use GDP to make investments decisions—a bad economy means lower earnings and lower stock prices.</p>

          <h2>Problems with using GDP</h2>
        </header>
        <p>Problems with using GDP as a measure for economic activity:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>GDP does not take into account negative effects on the environment such as pollution or use of natural resources</li>
          <li>Shadow economy (also known as black markets) is not taken into account including those working illegally</li>
          <li>People who are doing unpaid work (volunteering or within a family) are not included</li>
          <li>Everything that is produced and consumed by people themselves is not included in GDP (e.g. potatoes grown by Smith and consumed by his family are left unrecorded)</li>
          <li>Improvements in the quality of output produced are not considered</li>
        </ul>
