        <h2>What is Really Organic Honey</h2>

      <h2>Why Our Honey?</h2>
      <p class="text">All of the honey we sell is 100% pure honey, nothing adding and no adulteration is done to the honey. Every year can bring different tastes to varieties; such as, wildflower due to what is blooming since each year rain, sun, moisture, etc. all play a vital role in what plants are growing and providing nectar to the bees. We enjoy selling varieties of honey to folks and hope you enjoy honey as much as we do!</p>

        <p class="description">Wildflower honey is exactly what it sounds like. Derived from a variety of wildflowers and plants which are blooming during the summer months. Wildflower honey can range anywhere from a very dark honey to a light honey. Every year it changes with what blooms are produced by what plants. Rainfall and weather affect what plants are produced. If the honey is not single sourced (ie goldenrod, etc.), it is simply called wildflower honey. We can have various types of wildflower honey in the same year due to different hive locations in our area. Folks like wildflower honey for it's various characteristics in taste. This honey has a delightful taste and a great all around honey to use.</p>

        <h3>Buckwheat Honey <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/73/17/91/731791cf024a7d8217579cdb4603dac3.png" height="50" width="50" alt=""></h3>
        <p class="description">Buckwheat honey is pungent in flavor with molasses and malty tones and a lingering aftertaste. Buckwheat honey is also very dark in color. As a general rule, darker honeys tend to be higher in antioxidant compounds than lighter ones. Because of this characteristic, darker honeys also tend to be higher in mineral content on average, as compared to lighter honeys. The buckwheat plant is an excellent honey source, sometimes planted by beekeepers specifically for honey production. The blossoms are rich in nectar and blooming can continue into the fall. If you've never tried buckwheat - order a small amount since you'll either love it or hate it.</p>
